# JavaScript Problem Solving Practice

**Date:** April 22, 2025

Today, I practiced solving JavaScript problem-solving questions.

I learned about many built-in functions like `map`, `filter`, and how to use them effectively.  
I also understood where they are useful in real coding scenarios.

This practice helped me improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
